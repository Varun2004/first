        <h1><strong>Eletric Current</strong></h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>1.You have learnt that when silk is rubbed on glass,the glass develops positive electric charge and the silk,negative charge.</p>
        <p>2.These charges remain still on those bodies and are therefore called static electric charge.</p>
        <p>3.A flow or current of charges will be created.</p>
        <p>4.When water flows down a slope,we call it a current of water.</p>
        <p>5.Similarly,a flow of electric charges is called an current.</p>
        <p>6.In this chapter we are stydying the structure of cell.</p>
        <p>7.Their are three scientist who are introducting about cell.</p>
        <p>8.First simple cell or simple voltas cell.</p>
        <p>9.Second is leclanche cell.</p>
        <p>10.Third is dry cell.</p>
        <p>11.This are the cell that we will learn.</p>
        <P>12.I will show the diagram and give the information about cell.</P>
