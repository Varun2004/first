 <p>     iI arrived at a curious town
      Which is painted with curious hues;
      And there the kitten barks and barks,
      The puppy mews and mews.<P>

    <p>    And there the frog climbs up a tree
      And croks in curious way;
      "prepare for a shower of a plenting ice;
      this is going to hail today"</p>

    <P>  And the river flows in fire
      The volcano is packed dew
      The hues of rainbow are more than 8
      And the weeks of `days are only 2</P>

    </p>  And there you see a most curious sight
      Which can make a dead crow roar;
      The asses who roam have only 2 legs,
      Whilewho walk have 4<P>

        And the earth climbs up the sky
        The to till it sow the grains
        The boat os moving , over the rocks
        And over the seas the ,trains
        
        And NORTH and SOUTH exchange places
        To pass their play
        the sun is rising  in the night 
        The moon comes out in day time;
