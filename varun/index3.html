    <p>It's also important to be consistent in how you use headings across your
       site, so deciding on when and how to use headings is an
       important part of planning your site.</p>
    <b>Using paragraphs</b>
	<p>The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic
       formatting tags, and one that you'll use often.It indicates a

   <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
    <p>In this series of exercises, w'll explore how to use HTMLelements to format basic page content.</p>
    <b> Adding headings</b>
    <p>Headings help define the structure of the page and controlthe hierarchy of the content.
       You can use  heading values ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6.
       While there are several competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings,
       what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent manner,to
       paragraph of text, and should be used for each individual paragraph.
    <b>Line breaks</b>
    <p>Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that
       is,create a new line without using a new paragraph.To do 
       that in HTML, you use the line break tag (&lang;br&rang;).</p>
    <p>Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use them within
       headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.</p>
    <p>Let's say you were formatting an address, for example.
       You could use line breaks to make sure each line of the address
       appeared on a separate line, but still remained within the 
       same paragraph.
