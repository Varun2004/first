        <h1><strong>The Structur of atom</strong></h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2> 
           <p>1.Atom is a small particle that we can't break.
              2.There are three fundamentals of atom are neutron,electron and protron. 
              3.Neutron means there are on charge particles.
              4.Protron means there are positive charge particles.
              5.Electron means there are negative charge particles.
              6.In atom their is a nucleus in the centre.
              7.In the nucleus their are  protons and neutrons.
              8.And the electrons revolve around the nucleus in specfic orbit.
              9.In first orbit their are only two electrons and second orbit their are eight electrons.
              10.This is my introduction about structure of atom that i know.
              11.There are many scientists who has came and given theory about atom.
              12.Today i will give you information about one of the scientist name is "Rutherford's theory"and 
               examples of atoms model.
