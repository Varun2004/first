        <h1><strong>The Structur of atom</strong></h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2> 
           <p>1.Atom is a small particle that we can't break.</p>
           <p>2.There are three fundamentals of atom are neutron,electron and protron.</p> 
           <p>3.Neutron means there are on charge particles.</p>
           <p>4.Protron means there are positive charge particles.</p>
           <p>5.Electron means there are negative charge particles.</p>
           <p>6.In atom their is a nucleus in the centre.</p>
           <p>7.In the nucleus their are  protons and neutrons.</p>
           <p>8.And the electrons revolve around the nucleus in specfic orbit.</p>
           <p>9.In first orbit their are only two electrons and second orbit their are eight electrons.</p>
           <p>10.This is my introduction about structure of atom that i know.</p>
           <p>11.There are many scientists who has came and given theory about atom.</p>
           <p>12.Today i will give you information about one of the scientist name is "Rutherford's theory"and 
               examples of atoms model.</p>

        <h2><strong>Rutherford</strong></h2>

        <h1><strong>Rutherford's theory</strong></h2>
        <p>1.In rutherford's theory of atom the nucleus is in the centre .</p>
        <p>2.In the nucleus they have protrons and neutrons.</p>
        <p>3.And the electrons revolves around the nucleus which is in the centre.</p>
