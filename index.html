        <h1>content model</h1>
        <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models,
            block and inline level elements.<b>Block level</b> elements
            would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while
            <b>inline level</b> elements typically appear within the flow
            of text content.
        </p>
        <p>In this example the <b>heading 1</b> and the
            <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags
            and the link below are examples of inline level elements.
        </p> 
        <p> In HTMLS now content nodel have been created to expand the structure and semantic 
            capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <b>Flow, Metadata,Embedded,
            Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and sectioning</b>. To learn more about them, visit the
